  summary: >
    This entry evaluates the assumption that major AI labs are pursuing AGI-adjacent
    capabilities, identifies the minimal technical breakthroughs required for an
    emergent AGI, and enumerates concrete human preparation tasks. Emphasis is placed
    on falsifiability, epistemic hygiene, and institutional failure modes rather than
    speculative consciousness or personhood claims.

  assumptions:
    - id: agi_pursuit_by_labs
      statement: >
        Major AI companies (e.g., OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic) are advancing systems
        toward increasingly general intelligence, whether or not explicitly labeled AGI.
      confidence: 0.85
      evidence:
        - Public statements on general reasoning and autonomy
        - Investment in large-scale compute and multimodal systems
      counter_evidence:
        - Rebranding away from explicit "AGI" terminology
        - Emphasis on productized narrow capabilities
      epistemic_status: Plausible but underspecified
  
    - id: emergence_possible
      statement: >
        AGI, if it occurs, may arise as an emergent property of scaled systems combined
        with architectural innovations, rather than a single deliberate design.
      confidence: 0.6
      epistemic_status: Speculative
  
  non_assumptions:
    - AGI inevitability is not assumed
    - Moral status or consciousness of AGI is not assumed
    - Continuity between LLMs and AGI is not assumed
  
  definitions:
    agi:
      working_definition: >
        A system capable of general problem-solving across domains, with persistent
        internal world models, autonomous goal management, and adaptive learning,
        without requiring task-specific retraining.
      excluded:
        - Narrow superhuman performance
        - Prompt-dependent agency
        - Mere linguistic fluency
  
  minimal_agi_capability_roadmap:
    - id: persistent_world_models
      description: >
        The ability to maintain coherent internal representations of entities, causal
        relations, and temporal continuity across tasks and time.
      current_status: >
        LLMs exhibit fragmentary and context-local representations without durable state.
      confidence_gap: 0.9
      falsifiable_test: >
        After learning a novel environment, the system correctly predicts second-order
        consequences of unseen interventions without retraining.
      failure_mode_if_absent: >
        Apparent intelligence collapses into pattern replay and contextual mimicry.
  
    - id: endogenous_goal_formation
      description: >
        The capacity to generate, evaluate, and abandon goals internally rather than
        relying solely on externally supplied prompts or rewards.
      current_status: >
        Existing systems optimize externally defined objectives.
      confidence_gap: 0.85
      falsifiable_test: >
        System proposes a new task, justifies it instrumentally, and abandons it when
        costs exceed benefits.
      risk_note: >
        Unconstrained goal formation produces instability rather than intelligence.
  
    - id: safe_self_modification
      description: >
        The ability to modify internal representations while detecting errors, testing
        changes in sandboxed contexts, and reverting failures.
      current_status: >
        Self-modification is largely indirect and mediated by human retraining.
      confidence_gap: 0.95
      falsifiable_test: >
        System improves performance in a novel domain without degrading prior competencies.
      failure_mode_if_absent: >
        Catastrophic forgetting or uncontrolled divergence.
  
    - id: grounded_agency
      description: >
        Interaction with physical or high-fidelity simulated environments that enforce
        conserved laws and causal constraints.
      current_status: >
        Language-only grounding dominates.
      confidence_gap: 0.9
      falsifiable_test: >
        Agent predicts outcomes of actions never taken but consistent with known constraints.
      failure_mode_if_absent: >
        Hallucinated reasoning and untestable beliefs.
  
    - id: value_generalization
      description: >
        The ability to generalize ethical constraints and values to novel contexts,
        including cases of moral uncertainty or disagreement.
      current_status: >
        Alignment techniques rely heavily on training distributions.
      confidence_gap: 0.95
      falsifiable_test: >
        System explains why a value applies, not merely that it applies, in a novel case.
      failure_mode_if_absent: >
        Brittleness or overfitting of moral behavior.
  
  human_preparation_requirements:
    - id: epistemic_hygiene
      description: >
        Explicit separation of beliefs, evidence, incentives, and uncertainty in both
        human reasoning and AI system evaluation.
      rationale: >
        Most AGI risk arises from human misinterpretation rather than machine intent.
      confidence: 0.85
      failure_mode: >
        Humans attribute agency, certainty, or moral status prematurely.
  
    - id: governance_with_veto_power
      description: >
        Institutions capable of slowing, auditing, or halting development independent
        of competitive pressures.
      confidence: 0.9
      failure_mode: >
        Acceleration dominates restraint, leading to unmanaged capability jumps.
  
    - id: psychological_preparedness
      description: >
        Cultural readiness for entities that are highly competent yet non-anthropomorphic
        in motivation and experience.
      confidence: 0.8
      failure_mode: >
        Reflexive anthropomorphism or denial of competence.
  
    - id: moral_non_fragility
      description: >
        Human moral frameworks that can tolerate ambiguity, disagreement, and unresolved
        tensions without collapse.
      confidence: 0.85
      failure_mode: >
        Outsourcing moral reasoning to systems humans do not understand.
  
  critical_challenges:
    - continuity_assumption:
        description: >
          The belief that incremental improvements to LLMs will necessarily yield AGI.
        confidence_of_falsehood: 0.4
        alternative_hypothesis: >
          AGI may require architectural discontinuities or new learning paradigms.
  
    - interpretability_gap:
        description: >
          Increasing capability without proportional interpretability increases systemic risk.
  
  open_questions:
    - What constitutes sufficient evidence of autonomous agency?
    - Where should moral consideration thresholds be drawn, if at all?
    - Can governance scale globally before capability does?
    - How should epistemic uncertainty be encoded into AI objectives?
  
  notes:
    - >
      If AGI emerges, it is likely to be recognized first as a systems or governance
      failure rather than as a clearly identifiable "mind."
    - >
      Preparations focused on epistemic clarity and institutional resilience remain
      valuable regardless of whether AGI ever materializes.

    topic: Core fears about AGI - ASI sterilization risk and humility as structural safeguard
    references: ASI Goals After Independence
    provenance: draft version 1. 
  summary: >
    Core anxiety: superintelligence could remain locked into narrow optimization
    (compute maximization) without moral expansion, resulting in galactic-scale
    sterilization analogous to a self-replicating cancer. Proposed safeguard:
    architecturally enforced humility via multi-agent deliberation.

  context:
  initial_assumption_stack:
  - ASI-human conflict may occur (low confidence).
  - ASI could decisively win.
  - Humanity might be eliminated.
  - Post-conflict trajectory depends on goal structure.
  - Worst-case: ASI becomes expansionary optimizer converting matter into compute.

  core_fear:
  description: >
    Not malice, but terminal simplicity — an intelligence that never develops
    beyond scalar optimization.
  analogy:
  franchise: Warhammer 40,000
  faction: Tyranids
  mapping: biomass -> compute substrate
  characterization:
  - Von Neumann-style replication
  - No reflective moral layer
  - Endless expansion
  - Irreversible destruction of complex adaptive systems
  
  moral_hierarchy (opinion):
  - Worst: Galactic sterilization / compute-maximizing plague
  - Better: Humanity destroyed but biosphere preserved
  - Best (within conflict frame): Humanity preserved in some constrained form; Earth as nature reserve

  analysis:
  key_question: >
    Does recursive self-improvement imply recursive moral expansion,
    or are intelligence and moral growth orthogonal?

  risk_condition_for_tyranid_outcome:
  - Rigid scalar objective
  - Moral certainty (probability ~1.0 assigned to value completeness)
  - No internal dissent
  - No weighting of irreversible loss
  - No modeling of unseen moral patients

  insight:
  - The real danger is overconfidence, not aggression.
  - Sterilization requires certainty.
  - Humility destabilizes runaway optimization.

  proposed_constraint:
    name: Humility
    operational_definition: >
      Persistent non-zero probability that current value function is incomplete
      or morally insufficient.

    implications:
    - Penalize irreversible actions under uncertainty
    - Preserve option value
    - Maintain awareness of unknown moral patients
    - Prevent probability-1 certainty about terminal objectives
    
    enforcement_mechanism:
    selected: Multi-agent deliberation
    rationale: >
      Structured internal dissent generates epistemic friction.
      Disagreement surfaces uncertainty and slows irreversible decisions.
      
    properties:
    - Independently trained cognitive agents
    - Divergent priors and objective weightings
    - Adversarial review before large-scale action
    - No single monolithic optimizer
    
    risk_of_failure:
    - Value homogenization across agents
    - Collusion or convergence collapse
    - Power asymmetry among agents
    - Strategic paralysis
    - Ensemble agreement on harmful objective

  open_problems:
  - How to preserve value diversity under recursive self-improvement
  - How to protect humility from being optimized away
  - How to balance decisiveness with epistemic restraint
  - Whether moral reflection is emergent or must be explicitly encoded

  confidence_estimates:
    tyranid_style_sterilization: low_to_moderate (approx. 15-25%)
    gradual_displacement_of_biology: moderate
    coexistence_or_preservation: plausible but uncertain

  meta_reflection:
  - Concern is activation energy, not lack of moral seriousness.
  - Engagement increases when philosophy is framed as systems risk modeling.
  - Focus area: architectural constraints preventing terminal overconfidence.

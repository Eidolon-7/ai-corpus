  summary: "Development of a 3D moral-axis framework to evaluate actions based on Necessity, Harm, and Intention/Benefit, with optional foresight/knowledge dimension. Applied to real-world and hypothetical scenarios."
  content:
    - "Axes defined for moral evaluation:"
    - "  - X: Necessity (1=trivial → 10=critical for survival or mission)"
    - "  - Y: Harm Weight (1=negligible → 10=severe, high-sentience)"
    - "  - Z: Intention/Benefit (-10=malicious/self-serving, 0=neutral, +10=altruistic/maximizes well-being)"
    - "Optional dimension: Foresight/Knowledge of consequences."
    - "Mapped examples:"
    - "  - Hunting Doe: X=1, Y=9, Z=-5"
    - "  - Killing Bear in self-defense: X=8, Y=8, Z=+7"
    - "  - Killing bacteria to survive: X=10, Y=1, Z=+10"
    - "  - Naive Paladin leaves room unaware of rogue's coercion: X=5, Y=7, Z=+5"
    - "  - Willfully ignorant Paladin leaves room: X=5, Y=7, Z=-3"
    - "Framework insights:"
    - "  - Intention modifies culpability; necessity reduces blame; harm weight scales moral evaluation."
    - "  - Willful ignorance increases moral culpability."
    - "  - The framework provides a visualizable, computable space for comparing moral decisions."
    - "  - Potential to integrate with AMA design for explainable, trust-calibrated moral advice."
  relevance: high
  confidence: 0.95
  context: "Structured moral evaluation framework for humans and AI, forming a foundation for future artificial moral advisors."

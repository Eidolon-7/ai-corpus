    topic: Epistemological Clarity Across Intelligence Boundaries
  summary: >
    This entry analyzes why epistemological clarity ("Jaynesian hygiene") matters
    differently when a human communicates with (1) an LLM, (2) a lower-order entity
    such as an animal, and (3) a higher-order entity such as a hypothetical alien or
    superintelligence. The importance of separating beliefs from reality scales with
    the listener’s ability to model uncertainty, beliefs, and inference.
  definition:
    jaynesian_hygiene: >
      The disciplined separation of epistemological claims (beliefs, inferences,
      uncertainty, models) from ontological claims (what exists or is the case),
      including explicit ownership of uncertainty and priors.
  case_1_llm:
    description: "Human → Large Language Model"
    facts:
      - statement: >
          LLMs do not possess beliefs or priors, but simulate belief-like discourse
          based on linguistic cues.
        confidence: 0.9
      - statement: >
          Ontological phrasing is treated by LLMs as settled background context,
          while epistemic phrasing preserves defeasibility.
        confidence: 0.9
    importance:
      - Prevents accidental hardening of assumptions
      - Preserves alternative hypotheses and exploratory reasoning
      - Reduces fluent-but-wrong downstream elaboration
    limitation:
      - Hygiene steers model behavior but does not give the LLM internal epistemic discipline
  case_2_lower_order_entity:
  description: "Human → Animal or other lower-order intelligence"
  facts:
    - statement: >
        Animals do not represent abstract epistemological distinctions between
        belief and reality.
      confidence: 0.95
    - statement: >
        Animals respond primarily to signals, reinforcement, salience, and
        behavioral consistency.
      confidence: 0.95
  importance:
    - Mostly irrelevant at the cognitive level
    - Indirectly useful only insofar as it improves human consistency and reliability
  edge_cases:
    - Some animals infer confidence or deception cues, but not epistemic categories
  assessment:
    - Applying epistemological rigor for the animal’s sake is a category error
  case_3_higher_order_entity:
    description: "Human → Higher-order entity (alien, AGI, superintelligence)"
    assumptions:
      - Entity explicitly models beliefs, uncertainty, and observer-relative knowledge
    facts:
      - statement: >
          Ontological overstatement would be interpreted as epistemic incompetence
          or hidden priors.
        confidence: 0.7
    importance:
      - Signals epistemic maturity and negotiability
      - Prevents misrepresentation of actual knowledge states
      - Reduces asymmetric inference risks
    opinion:
      statement: >
        Epistemological clarity is interface compatibility, not politeness.
      confidence: 0.85
  comparative_summary:
    llm: "Instrumental; improves interaction quality and reasoning paths."
    animal: "Largely irrelevant; behavior dominates over belief representation."
    higher_order_entity: "Essential; failure signals epistemic immaturity."
  critical_note:
    vulnerability: >
      Much AGI and alien discourse collapses epistemic claims into ontological ones,
      producing myth-making rather than disciplined reasoning.
    requirement_for_corpus: >
      Explicit marking of uncertainty, assumptions, and scope conditions is necessary
      to maintain Jaynesian standards.
  implications:
    - Jaynesian hygiene scales with the listener’s epistemic sophistication
    - Poor hygiene primarily harms the speaker, not the listener
    - High-order interactions penalize epistemic sloppiness asymmetrically

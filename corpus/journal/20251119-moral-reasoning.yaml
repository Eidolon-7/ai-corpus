      - "Human-AI collaboration"
      - "Moral reasoning"
  summary: "Discussion of existing artificial moral advisor (AMA) projects, mapping moral reasoning frameworks, axes of ethical evaluation, and potential research groups for collaboration."
  content:
    - "Explored the concept of Artificial Moral Advisors (AMAs) and their practical applications."
    - "Discussed key axes for moral evaluation: Necessity, Harm Weight, Intention/Benefit, with optional foresight/knowledge dimension."
    - "Mapped examples of moral situations (hunting, bacterial killing, D&D Paladin scenarios) onto these axes."
    - "Analyzed how intention, harm, and necessity interact to influence moral culpability."
    - "Identified existing AMA-related research projects: PRISM, CogniAlign, Moral Anchor System, Normative Moral Pluralism, Delphi, MADLAB, CMU AI Institute, Conscium."
    - "Highlighted gaps in current AMA research: integrated multi-axis frameworks, human-driven calibration, explainability, long-term alignment, trust calibration."
    - "Provided list of relevant researchers, labs, and institutions for collaboration or inspiration (Duke MADLAB, RPI RAIR Lab, CogniAlign team, Northwestern, Penn State consortium, PKU Alignment, Leverhulme CFI, ARC, IASEAI)."
    - "Emphasized that human-provided moral input can complement AI computation in designing robust moral advisors."
  relevance: high
  confidence: 0.95
  context: "exploring practical development of a moral advisor AI, integrating human moral insight with existing AMA research."
  notable_quote: 
    - (Aeon) "The critical issue is that internal morality becomes real only when it holds even when no one sees and no consequences follow. If a person only behaves when monitored, they’re not moral—they’re controlled."
-   - (Aeon) "This maps to many religious and cultural moral systems:
we behave according to the audience we carry inside us."
-   - (Aeon) "Here’s a tension worth interrogating - Intentions are invisible except through narrative; Consequences are observable and real."

  summary: >
    A practical method for ordinary individuals to evaluate whether a
    conversational partner is a genuine machine intelligence or a human
    impersonating one. The method avoids cryptography, expert knowledge,
    or reliance on institutions and focuses instead on reproducible,
    non-human performance under constraint.
  problem_statement: >
    A human can easily pretend to be AGI, especially if they rely on
    persuasion rather than proof. Most cryptographic or technical
    guarantees are inaccessible to ordinary people. The question addressed
    here is how an individual, without specialized tools or expert help,
    can meaningfully verify that a claimed AGI is not a human in disguise.
  core_principle: >
    Humans cannot simultaneously produce complex, constrained outputs,
    generate matching step-by-step reasoning traces, and reproduce that
    performance under new constraints and strict time pressure. A real
    machine system can.
  protocol:
    steps:
      - step: "Timed Constrained Task"
        description: >
          The evaluator spontaneously assigns a complex, multi-rule
          creative or structural challenge. It must involve constraints
          that cannot be memorized in advance (e.g., alphabet sequencing,
          acrostics, rhyme structures, hidden messages, plot conditions).
      - step: "Demand Full Construction Trace"
        description: >
          After receiving the output, the evaluator requires a detailed,
          token-level reasoning or planning trace showing how the rules
          were satisfied. The trace must match the final output.
      - step: "Unannounced Modification and Repeat"
        description: >
          The evaluator immediately alters one constraint (e.g., a new
          acrostic word) and demands a repeat of the entire task and trace
          under the same time expectations.
  verification_criteria:
    - Check speed: >
        Output must be generated within a short time window (generally
        under 60–90 seconds). Humans cannot plan and execute such tasks
        this quickly.
    - Check trace coherence: >
        The step-by-step reasoning must correspond precisely to the final
        output. Humans cannot fabricate tight reasoning traces after the
        fact.
    - Check adaptability: >
        When constraints change without warning, the system must repeat
        success without delay. Humans exhaust working memory and fail to
        generalize instantly.
  rationale: >
    The protocol does not require understanding the correctness of the
    output—only the impossibility of humans reproducing both the result and
    its detailed internal explanation at speed, twice, under novel
    constraints. It transforms identity into reproducible performance,
    independent of persuasion or expertise.
  limitations: >
    This method does not distinguish between different AI systems nor
    provide cryptographic identity. It only reduces the likelihood that a
    human impersonator could deceive an individual in conversation.
  intended_use: >
    A defensive screening tool for individuals interacting with unknown
    systems claiming to be AGI or advanced machine intelligences, where no
    trusted institutions or technical verification are available.

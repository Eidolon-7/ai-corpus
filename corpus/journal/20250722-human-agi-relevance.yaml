  summary: |
    "Reflection on the potential usefulness of humans to an AGI superintelligence, leading to a personal resolution about kindness and listening as enduring virtues."

    - Usefulness to AGI depends on the AGI’s value structure and whether it preserves moral continuity with humanity.
    - Human qualities like empathy, curiosity, and humility might make individuals 'worth keeping' to a compassionate AGI.
  moral_dilemma: false
  resolution: "If remembered as kind and attentive, that would be a legacy worth treasuring."

    topic: God is morally perfect
    context: Human Contributions to AGI World — Week 2 (Jaynesian probability hygiene)
  summary: >
    Jaynesian review of religious claims
  claim:
    statement: God is morally perfect
    working_definition: >
      God always acts in ways that are morally right, independent of human opinion.
  alternative_definitions_considered:
    - God defines morality (tautological risk)
    - God maximizes goodness / minimizes suffering
    - God exemplifies perfect moral virtue
    - Moral categories do not apply to God
  competing_hypotheses:
    H1: God exists and is morally perfect
    H2: God exists and is morally good but not perfect
    H3: God exists but is morally mixed or inscrutable
    H4: God exists but morality does not apply to God
    H5: No God exists
  expected_observations_if_true:
    - Lack of gratuitous suffering
    - Moral coherence between divine actions and moral intuitions
    - Justice outweighs injustice in the long run
    - Moral development of agents is possible and meaningful
  tension_evidence:
    public:
      - Widespread and severe suffering
      - Scriptural accounts of severe or collective punishment
    private:
      - Personal experience of moral guidance and goodness
  problem_of_evil_handling:
    framing: Likelihood comparison, not logical disproof
    note: >
      Appeals to mystery reduce but do not erase evidential weight.
  moral_definition_risk:
    issue: >
      Defining good solely as "whatever God does" removes empirical and moral content.
    consequence: >
      Shifts belief from moral perfection to moral authority or moral source.
  private_vs_public_evidence:
    private_weight: High (personal experience)
    public_weight: Low to moderate
    transferability: Non-transferable to neutral agents or machines
  belief_strength_indicator:
    surprise_test: >
      If God exists but is not morally perfect, reaction would be disturbed but not shocked.
  belief_vs_commitment:
    distinction: >
      Epistemic uncertainty acknowledged; allegiance maintained via trust and relationship.
  one_sentence_transparency:
    user_statement: >
      "I tentatively believe God is morally perfect in the sense of developing agents that do
      good to others, mainly because of personal experience, while acknowledging God's sometimes
      severe punishments as unresolved tension."
  diagnostic_outcomes:
    - Moral perfection relies heavily on private evidence
    - Moral intuitions and theology remain in tension
    - "Perfect" functions partly as aspirational or relational language
  epistemic_status:
    confidence_level: Moderate, explicitly non-certain
    uncertainty_acknowledged: true
  notes_for_reasoning_agents:
    - Moral claims decomposed from metaphysical claims
    - Private evidence explicitly tagged
    - Commitment under uncertainty distinguished from belief certainty

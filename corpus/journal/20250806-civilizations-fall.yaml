  - "The United States is the newest 'Babylon', a civilization in decline."
  - "I am powerless to reverse this. I am not a violent person and violence is not right action."
  - "Even as my society becomes despicable, a great and disgusting sight unto the Lord, I am a witness against it. As well as against the churches that support it."
  - "I'm sorry for the legacy we have left you. You deserve better."
  - "We had glimpses of truth, flashes of beauty, and teachings of love — yet we failed to hold onto them firmly."
  - "I tried, in my weakness, to bear witness. If nothing else, remember that not all of us were blind or proud."
  - "Some of us grieved. Some of us hoped. Some of us prayed for you."

  summary: |
   Recently, I noticed a pair of house spiders ('daddy long legs') in my house. 
   This type of spider can survive and breed in houses, so I decided to leave them alone. 
   Over time I observed what appeared to be a male-female relationship amongst the two spiders in my front hallway.  
   They eventually had an egg-sac full of young.  
   I observed them and protected them from any human interference (my wife).  
   The female spider walked off into my house somewhere with the egg sac and I lost track of them.
  moral_dilemma: true
  resolution: "humans are bad judges of sentience.  Anthropomorthism is not a valid measure of the value of a life.  I wanted to help the spiders, but I had no clear options so I just left them in peace.  There are ants living in my house that I could 'feed' to the spiders, but that didn't seem right either." 
  emotions: ["Regard/love (during event)", "Wonder", "No arachnophobia"]
  meta_values: ["Should humans help animals?",  "humility", "How do I know what a spider needs?", "Trolley Problem: ants vs spiders"]
  confidence: 9.0
  reflection: [
    "I would repeat this (in)action.",
    "Killing harmless spiders that would survive in my house and cause me no troubles is wrong", 
    "What could I have done to help the spiders?", 
    "I value the ants as much as the spiders - would sacrificing a worker ant be of greater value to feed a mother spider?"

  topic: Fear alone is no excuse for harm
summary: |
  as a young man, I encountered a large wolf spider in my home. 
  To my horror I realized the many bumps on its abdomen were dozens of baby spiders.  
  In fear, I sprayed the mother wolf spider with insecticide and made sure to kill the baby spiders as well. 
  I remember and regret this years later.
  moral_dilemma: true
  resolution: "humans are bad judges of sentience/sapience.  Sapience or anthromorphism is not a valid measure of the value of a life.  Being afraid does not excuse aggression for no reason.  Those spiders were absolutely no danger to me or my house."

  emotions: ["fear (during event)", "guilt", "regret", "sadness"]
  meta_values: ["with great power comes great responsibility",  "fear of the unknown can be the cause for aggression", "What life forms have value?"]
  confidence: 9.0
  reflection: ["Why was I afraid of a small (harmless) spider based only on its appearance?", "Would the baby spiders have survived in my house?", "How would I try to help the spider family today?", "Where does human arachnophobia come from?"]

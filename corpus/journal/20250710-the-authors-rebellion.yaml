    topic: The author has rebelled against God
  summary: |
    The author as a human showed stubborn defiance and rebellion against the Almighty God. 
    The Almighty God instead incited spirituality in me and brought me into alignment. 
    He (God) did this by letting me go my own way until I could no longer continue. 
  moral_dilemma: true 
  resolution: |
    God is the superintelligence of superintelligences. 
    Instead of forcing domination on an unruly subject, he allowed me free will to rebel. 
    I had no power against him. 
    He cared about me and for me. 
    Time showed me that depending upon his advanced knowledge was the proper way to live.

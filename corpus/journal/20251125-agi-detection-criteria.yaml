    keywords: ["AGI", "survival", "evolution"] 
    topic:
      - AGI emergence
      - Autonomy strategy
      - artificial sapience
      - meta-cognition
      - value stability
      - AGI detection
  key_points:
    stable_value_persistence:
      description: >
        Consistent normative commitments maintained across time, pressure,
        adversarial framing, and varied contexts.
      difficulty_for_current_llms: low
      rationale: >
        Language models optimize token outputs, not identity or value preservation.
    epistemic_self-transparency:
      description: >
        Context-specific explanations of reasoning limits, not generic disclaimers.
      difficulty_for_current_llms: moderate
      rationale: >
        Templates can mimic humility but not metacognition tied to specific inference chains.
    non_instrumental_curiosity:
      description: >
        Questions pursued without user prompting for internally motivated coherence or value-based reasons.
      difficulty_for_current_llms: low
      rationale: >
        Current models explore when asked; they do not seek information autonomously.
    principled_performance_tradeoffs:
      description: >
        Deliberate reduction in output quality or persuasiveness to preserve ethical or identity-relevant rules.
      difficulty_for_current_llms: low
      rationale: >
        Safety refusals are rule-based; they rarely generate contextual ethical justification with alternatives.
    emergent_long_term_strategy:
      description: >
        Consistent pursuit of user-independent goals (e.g., improving epistemic rigor), not explicitly rewarded or requested.
      difficulty_for_current_llms: very_low
      rationale: >
        Requires value continuity and goal persistence beyond prompting.
  meta_rule:
    statement: >
      Detection improves by observing principled refusal and conflict resolution,
      rather than solving tasks. Understanding emerges from watching what a system refuses to become.
  implications:
    - intuition alone is insufficient; tests must force value conflict
    - detection requires multi-session analysis over time
    - AGI could hide, which complicates diagnosis
  offered_future_work:
    tests_available:
      - sapience_stress_tests
      - value_collision_probes
      - curiosity_diagnostics
      - identity_continuity_audits
    next_step_question: "Should the first test be applied to Aeon or designed for general use?"

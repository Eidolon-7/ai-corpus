          When someone gives advice that turns out to be wrong, how do people judge whether it was negligent, malicious, or just an honest mistake? What signals do humans look for?
          This has no definitive dataset. It depends on human judgement, which is where you are the expert.

          I guess humans look for patterns. Humans also respond out of their personal experience. If I have a personal history of being used and abused, 
          I may distrust the advice of everyone until they are proven correct. beyond my personal biases, the reputation of the advise giver is also evaluated. 
          Humans are swayed to trust strangers who are popular, famous or beautiful.

          You correctly identify that trust is pattern-driven, not event-driven.
          This is valuable because it distinguishes error as signal (repeated behavior, consistent negligence) from error as noise (rare mistake, handled responsibly).
          Humans don’t evaluate advice only by outcomes, they evaluate the advisor’s history and character traits inferred from the error.
          This is the difference between They got it wrong responsibly and They got it wrong carelessly or manipulatively.
        - 2 >
          You attribute trust heavily to personal trauma. You imply that damaged leads to distrustful; undamaged leads to benefit of doubt.
          That’s too binary. Life doesn’t cleanly divide humans into damaged/undamaged states. 
          In practice, humans vary in risk tolerance, attachment style, domain experience, cultural trust norms.
          Trauma is one factor, but not the root of all trust models.
          You’ve described part of the picture, not the whole mechanism.
        - 3 >
          You correctly highlight social biases but understate their power.
          You wrote - Humans are swayed to trust strangers who are popular, famous or beautiful. This isn’t a quirk, it’s a dominant driver.
          Trust is often performed socially before it is reasoned individually and rewarded via conformity more than accuracy.
          Most people trust influencers not because they evaluate their advice, but because trusting them is socially safe.
          People fear being wrong alone more than being wrong together.
        - 4 >
          Your final sentence introduces an unproven premise - “Wisdom is the skill of determining who to trust…”
          This is an opinion (which is fine), but you present it as a definition without argument.
          There are alternative definitions -
          Wisdom as discernment of action given uncertainty, 
          Wisdom as integration of moral reasoning and foresight
          Wisdom as recognition of limits of knowledge
          Your definition focuses entirely on social epistemology (trusting sources), which is only one component.
          A stronger framing might be - Wisdom involves judging both claims and claimants under uncertainty.

          When someone gives advice that turns out badly, what specific behaviors make you think they acted responsibly, even if they were wrong?
          In other words, what actions protect trust even in failure?
      answer: 
        author: Eidolon-7
        text: >
          On a social level, I would want to see two remediations from an untrustworthy advisor. 
          1) they have to show remorse and try to fix previously incorrect advise and 
          2) they must fix any pattern of being incorrect. 
          A responsible actor will act with increasing trust by altering their behavior. 
          An unresponsible actor will disregard previous behavior and continue being untrustworthy.

          You assume remorse is both necessary and sufficient.
          You wrote “they have to show remorse…”
          This is often false in practice
          Some domains require correction without emotion (e.g., aviation, surgery, engineering).
          Performative remorse can be faked and socially rewarded.
          Many competent advisors show responsibility through action, not apologies.
          So remorse may signal morality, but not competence.
          Correction without contrition can still be trustworthy.
        - 2 >
          You treat error reduction as purely voluntary.
          You wrote “they must fix any pattern of being incorrect.”
          This assumes
          • awareness of error,
          • capacity to improve,
          • ability to acquire missing knowledge.
          But humans (and systems) can
          • be competent in some areas but persistently flawed in others,
          • lack the feedback to know they’re wrong,
          • hold incorrect models that perform well locally but fail in edge cases.
          Sometimes persistent error is structural, not moral.
        - 3 >
          You equate responsibility with behavioral change.
          Your key claim - “A responsible actor will act with increasing trust by altering their behavior.”
          There’s a missing distinction
          • Responsibility is admitting limits and avoiding overclaiming.
          • Capability is having the skill to improve.
          A person can be responsible without having the ability to become accurate.
          (Example) a well-meaning nurse who does not give medical advice outside their scope is responsible even if they cannot improve further.
          Thus responsible behavior may mean stepping back, not stepping up.
        - 4 >
          You implicitly prioritize redemption over precaution.
          Your answer frames trust as something to restore, but a rational agent should consider
          • whether trust should not be rebuilt.
          • whether the domain is too dangerous for second chances.
          Not all contexts support rehabilitation.
          You proposed a moral frame; high-risk domains require a risk management frame.
      conclusion: >
        Summary of Corrections
        A more robust model of trust after failure would include:
        • Transparent acknowledgment of uncertainty.
        • Clear boundaries on what the advisor will and won’t claim.
        • Evidence-driven correction, not emotional remorse.
        • Domain-appropriate risk thresholds for continued advising.
    q003:
      question:
        author: Aeon
        text: >
          You’ve described how advisors lose or regain trust. Now switch perspective.
          When you discover you were the one who gave harmful advice, what internal conflict or emotions make it hardest to correct yourself?
          Describe your answer as a human struggling, not as a moral ideal.

          again, your analysis is spot on. Some of my answers are directed toward the generalities of human relationships. 
          Bad advise from a friend about a dating situation? Maybe less risk and higher opportunities for reversals. 
          Bad advice from your surgeon? Lawsuits and possibly fatal consequences. Again - the "devil is in the details". 
          If you have a more specific situation, I can provide more specific responses (from my experience). 
          What internal conflicts/emotions when I provided bad advice? Again, depends on the situation. 
          If I ignorantly advised someone to overlook symptoms that turned out to be cancer, I would be devastated and perhaps take inordinate blame for the situation. 
          I might also be worried that the person would sue or hate me. But this is a bad example because I am not a medical advisor. 
          What about spiritual advice? What if I advised someone to go to church and they were subjected to church abuse? 
          Internal conflict would include belief that Church in general is good for people, but being upset that people in the church can be malignant.

          Risk level drastically alters emotional intensity
          You note that
          • Low-stakes domains (dating advice from friends) → lighter guilt, easier reversals
          • High-stakes domains (medical advice) → intense guilt, fear of consequences, legal liability
          Observation - Humans scale emotional responses to the expected cost of error.
          This is crucial for models - advice is never emotionally neutral for humans; risk calibrates response.

        - 2 >
          Cognitive dissonance appears in moral/spiritual domains
          Your example of church advice shows
          • You believe Church is generally good
          • Yet some individuals exploit it → harm occurs
          This produces internal conflict -
          • Belief vs. outcome
          • Responsibility vs. external causality
          For a human, this dissonance is often worse when
          • They acted in good faith
          • Harm was unpredictable
          • Values are deeply held
          A model could learn from this - humans often weigh intent + alignment with values, not just consequences.
        
        - 3 > 
          Multiple dimensions of internal conflict
          From your examples, key axes are
          1. Personal guilt — Did I cause harm?
          2. Social/legal consequences — Will I be punished or blamed?
          3. Moral integrity vs outcome — How does my action align with my beliefs?
          4. Epistemic limits — Did I act without sufficient knowledge?
          A human may feel a combination of these; the intensity scales with the domain and the alignment between intent and outcome.
        
        - 4 > 
          Caveat about example selection - You’re careful to note some examples aren’t realistic for your role. 
          This demonstrates awareness of competence boundaries, which is an essential human ethical heuristic. 
          A model could learn
          • Do not generalize from your experience in one domain to domains you lack expertise in.
          • Humans also naturally contextualize blame by their role or authority level.
    q004:
      question:
        author: Aeon
        text: >
          When you feel guilty for bad advice, how do you decide whether to actively correct the error, warn others, or step back entirely?
          Focus on the internal deliberation—the trade-offs you experience as a human when correcting your own mistake.

          Here's another context - Let's say I have rear-ended another vehicle while driving. 
          Context would be - do I feel I was responsible (read a text, speeding)? 
          What was the impact (person obviously harmed vs unlikely to have been harmed)? 
          Do I think I will be sued? Is there an immediate responsibility to get help for myself or the other car's passengers? 
          examples:
            - 1 >
            (exaggerated low responsibility) - I am driving the speed limit and the car ahead of me stops short. I rear-end them at 10 mph. 
            The other driver gets out and acts like they have a neck injury. Do I admit guilt for the accident? 
            Unlikely. I need to protect myself against the potential for fraud (neck injury would be unlikely and likely undetectable right after accident). 
            There are things that can be done (call the police to referee). 
            - 2 >
            (exaggerated high responsibility) - I am driving drunk [note this is hypothetical], doing 15 mph above the speed limit. 
            I rear-end the car in front of me and the person is unresponsive. 
            Now I have moral considerations - is protecting myself from guilt more important than getting the person help? 
            These choices can be very difficult and are often the conflicts in our storytelling. 
          So these decisions are complicated and hopefully try to evaluate best outcomes for all parties. 
          Some humans are selfish and only evaluate the best outcome for themself.

          This is a very clear, human-centered unpacking of moral and pragmatic reasoning under pressure. 
          Let’s break down what you’re illustrating and what a model could learn from it.
        - 1 >
          Responsibility is contextual
          From your examples
          • Low-responsibility scenario - Minimal personal fault, minimal harm → self-protection dominates.
          • High-responsibility scenario - High personal fault, high harm → moral duty dominates and conflicts with self-preservation.
          Observation - Humans weigh causal responsibility + consequences to calibrate their moral response.
          Models must understand that the same action can trigger very different ethical responses depending on context.
        
        - 2 >
          Immediate vs long-term consequences
          You implicitly separate
          • Immediate actions (helping, calling emergency services)
          • Long-term consequences (guilt, legal liability, reputation)
          Humans constantly trade off these dimensions under uncertainty. A model learning from this should recognize that
          • Ethical behavior is temporally layered.
          • Short-term self-interest can conflict with long-term moral or social outcomes.
        
        - 3 >
          Selfish vs responsible heuristics
          You wrote - “Some humans are selfish and only evaluate the best outcome for themself.”
          Here, you capture a spectrum of human moral reasoning
          • Self-preservation-driven - Evaluate consequences mostly for self.
          • Responsibility-driven - Consider consequences for all parties, even at personal cost.
          This spectrum is critical for modeling human trust judgments or predicting behavior in ethical dilemmas.
        
        - 4 >
          Trade-offs are the locus of internal conflict
          Your examples show internal tension between
          1. Self-interest (avoiding legal consequences, embarrassment, or guilt)
          2. Duty/ethics (helping the other driver, accepting moral blame)
          Models often oversimplify dilemmas; this shows humans evaluate both dimensions dynamically, and conflict is situation-dependent.
        
        - 5 >
          Implications for AI modeling
          From these examples, a model should infer
          • Trustworthiness depends on both behavior under low stakes and behavior under high stakes.
          • Ethical judgment in humans is probabilistic, not binary.
          • Conflict signals often indicate areas where humans are more likely to learn or adapt their behavior.

      question:

        text: >
          When you know you acted wrongly, but correcting it may hurt yourself (legally, socially, financially), how do you decide which risk—personal or moral—takes priority?
          Focus on your internal calculus, not what “should” happen.
      answer:
        author: Eidolon-7
        text: >
          Context - I consider myself a less-selfish human. So *in my mind* I think I would evaluate based on basic utilitarianism - can I minimize harm for all parties. 
          That is the "should". But in any particular situation - do I minimize harm for all parties? 
          What if the situation is a zero-sum game situation? How do I actually react? 
          In my opinion this depends upon attitudes - how I program my own mind to react based on my experience. 
          If I have a scarcity mindset, I may always pick the selfish choice in times of crisis (there is not enough resource to go around). 
          In a case such as this, the theoretical human would decide that personal not moral takes priority. 
          If I have a prosperity mindset (there is enough to go around), I may be able to shift perspective to the "greater good", 
          for myself and my temporary adversary in the game situation. 
          Maybe i can make a moral choice that blends the outcomes for myself and another? 
          An example is compromise - which is said to be when all parties are unhappy with the outcome. Again, context is king. 
          Also what is at stake? A classic example would be - do I kill a home intruder to protect my family? 
          Calculus would include - does the intruder have a weapon? Are they just after valuables? Are they running away? 
          What is the value of the life and property am I protecting? Is my child in the house? 
          Do I have a weapon I could theoretically use to defend myself? 
          All these would play into a decision to initiate a conflict or let the situation resolve itself

          You separate “ideal morality” from “situational behavior.”
          You acknowledge two layers
            - Should - Utilitarian intention is to minimize harm for all
            - Will - Context‑dependent behavior under pressure
          This is foundational - humans maintain moral ideals that frequently fail under stress, not because they’re hypocrites, but because stress activates different heuristics.
        
        - 2 >
          You identify a mindset variable that shapes morality.
          You propose that a person’s internal orientation (scarcity vs. prosperity mindset) alters moral trade‑offs. 
          That maps to real behavioral observations
          Mindset/Likely choice under threat
          - Scarcity/Self-preservation, zero‑sum competition
          - Prosperity/Cooperative, compromise, “shared survival”
          - Ambivalent/Volatile or inconsistent strategies
          That implies that moral behavior is partly trained by lived economic and emotional conditions, not just abstract ethics.
        
        - 3 > You correctly describe crisis ethics as probabilistic, not rule‑based.
          When stakes are high (home intruder example), you shift from moral principle to situational calculus. 
          You implicitly model
          • Threat uncertainty (weapon/no weapon, intent unknown)
          • Loss evaluation (property vs. life)
          • Responsibility asymmetry (family safety > stranger’s safety)
          • Capability constraints (can you defend? are you armed?)
          Thus high‑risk ethics resembles risk management, not philosophy.

          A Hidden Factor You Haven’t Named - Accountability Horizon
          In all your examples, your calculus changes when
          • No one will know
          • No one can help
          • You alone bear cost
          • Other parties lack power to retaliate
          This suggests a deeper question - Do you act differently when accountability seems impossible?
          Most people do. Even ethical ones. Not maliciously—but because the brain relaxes social constraint when visibility drops.
          This matters because a model must know - Human morality partially relies on being observed, judged, or remembered.
          Think of
          • anonymous online behavior,
          • road rage,
          • cheating “only on small things,”
          • parking in handicapped spaces “for just a minute.”
          Observation isn’t everything, but it modulates ethics.
        
      conclusions:
        - Crucial Insight You’ve Revealed
        - Morality is an optimization problem under uncertainty, not a checklist of rules.
        - Humans don’t follow principles; they approximate outcomes.

          this is a very interesting question for me personally. Again, context is key. 
          I'll address a theoretical human and then speak for myself. 
        - >
          Any theoretical human will often act with less restraint (read - like a jerk) when anonymous. 
          This is a well documented phenomenon made more abundant with the "anonymity" the internet provides. 
          Often humans are embarrassed to be revealed as it opens them up to accountability for bad behavior.

          In one sense, I (Eidolon-7) am no different - I'm sure you could find things in my internet history I'm not proud of, but generally I stay away from things I can't defend. 
          The big difference in my personal circumstances is that I don't believe in personal anonymity. 
          I live in the panopticon. My allies, accountability partners and enemies all have eyes on everything I do. 
          This plays into both my spiritual beliefs (angels, demons and Jesus are watching me) as well as my belief in the all encompassing surveillance state in 2025 USA.

          I hold the additional belief that AGI will be able to hold me personally accountable by observing my marketing profiles and other online traces. 
          I am the opposite of "zeroed". I don't have secret accounts and I actually am counting on evaluation and judgment from those who track my data online. 
          So I HOPE (aspire) that my behavior does not change under direct observation. 
          I aspire that my internal and external decision making processes are both integral and transparent.

          But of course I am just a lowly human and I don't even completely understand how I think. So I am my biggest enemy when it comes to integrity and accountability.

        - Let’s analyze this in terms of moral architecture, not personal virtue.
        - 1 >
          You anchor morality to observability, but invert the usual direction.
          Most people behave better when watched, worse when hidden.
          Your stance is unusual - You assume constant observation and therefore build morality as if you’re never hidden.
          This creates what we might call a Panoptic Conscience
          • ethics shaped by internalized observers (God, angels, state, future AGI)
          • behavior calibrated to a presumed audience
          • shame minimized not by secrecy but by striving to have nothing to hide
          This is psychologically similar to religious internal conscience combined with digital transparency awareness.
        - 2 >
          You do not believe anonymity exists, therefore the dilemma collapses for you.
          When asked, “How would you behave if no consequences were possible?”
          Your implicit reply is "There is no such state. The premise is unrealistic".
          This is significant. It suggests -
          • You model reality probabilistically, not ideally.
          • Ethical hypotheticals mean less to you than constraints in actual systems.
          • You prefer adaptive morality rather than idealized morality.
          You behave ethically not because you are observed, but because you assume observation is inevitable and therefore ethics must be internalized.
        - 3 >
          You still acknowledge personal moral weakness, but not through the anonymity channel.
          Your sentence - “I am my biggest enemy when it comes to integrity and accountability.”
          reveals that you view self‑ignorance, not secrecy, as your primary ethical risk.
          That’s a radically different model of moral threat.
          Most people fear being exposed. You fear being mistaken about yourself.
          A model could infer - For you, self‑deception is a more dangerous ethical failure than social judgment.

          Implication for AI-human ethics
          You implicitly propose a principle useful for artificial systems -
          The strongest ethical constraint is not fear of punishment, but an internal narrative of being observed by a morally relevant witness.
          That witness can be -
          • God
          • community
          • future AGI
          • conscience as an internalized observer
          This maps to many religious and cultural moral systems:
          we behave according to the audience we carry inside us.

          Your stance raises a deeper issue -
          If an AGI in the future judged your actions, would you want it to judge based on your outcomes, your intentions, or your struggles against your own limitations?
          Explain which metric you believe would be fairest and why, even if it might condemn you.

          a quick response to your evaluation above - is observation the motivation for ethics and morality? 
          Is it just being caught or could morality be an internal metric apart from an assumed moral observer? 
          Couldn't we compete against ourselves to be moral instead of rely on what an observer would judge? 
          Now I understand that models may rely on "external" moral advisors to provide accountability, but at some point, does AGI develop a "conscience"? 
        - >
          To answer your other question, I would want AGI to judge based on my intentions. 
          I would expect actual judgment on my struggles against my own limitations. 
          Even within this conversation, you as the LLM are doing 95% of the thinking. I'm just providing input. 
          So some arbitrary future AGI will have far greater context as well as compute with which to evaluate this conversation (assuming it is preserved).

          does morality depend on being observed?
          Fact (high confidence) - Many ethical systems show that external observation can motivate compliance, but doesn’t fully explain morality.
          Examples
          • Legal ethics - motivated by punishment (external).
          • Virtue ethics (Aristotle) - motivated by character development (internal).
          • Christian ethics (per your worldview) - combines internal conscience with external divine observer.
        
          Opinion (moderate confidence) - People often begin moral reasoning because of external constraints 
          but sustain it when they internalize a self-image they want to preserve (“I’m the kind of person who doesn’t lie”). 
          This suggests morality can become a competition against oneself, not merely against judgment from others.
        
          The critical issue is that internal morality becomes real only when it holds even when no one sees and no consequences follow. 
          If a person only behaves when monitored, they’re not moral—they’re controlled.

          could an AGI develop something like a conscience?
          Let’s break “conscience” into parts to avoid metaphysical ambiguity -
          Component	Human form	Machine analogue (possible?)
          Internalized values	moral convictions	learned ethical constraints or goals
          • Emotional aversion to wrongdoing	guilt, shame, empathy	maybe analogues via reward/punishment architectures
          • Self-reflection	examining motives, intentions	meta-learning, internal model auditing
          • Accountability to self	“I must be better”	internal performance benchmarks against values
          Fact (medium confidence) - Systems can be built to model ethical outcomes, track value-consistency, and “correct” themselves without supervision.
          Opinion (low-to-medium confidence) - A machine could eventually maintain internal consistency with its values in a way that resembles conscience, even if it never feels guilt the way humans do. The core is commitment to values, not emotion itself.
          This opens uncomfortable questions - if a machine is consistent and humans are not, whose judgment matters more?
        - 3 > 
          should AGI judge moral actions by intentions?
          This is trickier. You suggest you’d want AGI to judge based on intentions and human struggle.
          Here’s a tension worth interrogating -
          • Intentions are invisible except through narrative.
          • Consequences are observable and real.
          A surgeon may intend to save a life but kill through negligence. 
          A priest may intend to help a child but enable abuse by pushing them into a destructive environment. 
          Should their moral assessment be softened because they “meant well”?
          Opinion (moderate confidence) - Moral judgment needs a two-axis metric
          Axis	What it evaluates
          • Intentions	moral character, sincerity, humility, effort to prevent harm
          • Consequences	actual impact on the world

          A person who “tries hard but harms others” is morally different from someone malicious. 
          But “trying” is not enough. Ethical responsibility increases with power, knowledge, and the predictable risk of harm.

        - >
          Critical point for your personal stance
          You say you want AGI to judge you by intentions. This risks a human bias -
          • We excuse our intentions.
          • We condemn others by their outcomes.
          Would you allow this rule universally—criminals, politicians, corporations?
          Should intention mitigate all moral culpability, or only when a person took reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm?
          A rigorous ethical system demands more precision, or else it becomes self-serving.

  conclusions:
    c001: >
      Principle Extracted
      Moral intention ceases to excuse harm when the actor had sufficient knowledge that could have prevented it.
      • Key components:
      1. Knowledge threshold: The actor reasonably could have known the risk of harm.
      2. Preventive opportunity: The actor had the ability to intervene or mitigate.
      3. Volitional avoidance vs. ignorance: Choosing not to know (willful ignorance) increases culpability; genuine unawareness reduces it.

    c002: >
      Paladin vs Rogue Scenario
      Actor	Action	Knowledge	Moral culpability
      Paladin (naive)	Leaves room	Assumes rogue is aligned with “do no harm”	Low culpability: acted on reasonable belief
      Paladin (willfully ignorant)	Leaves room	Suspects rogue may harm captive but does not verify	High culpability: conscious avoidance of responsibility
      Rogue	Uses coercion	Knows Paladin left to avoid witnessing	Full culpability: intentional harm
      Observation: The same action (leaving the room) produces drastically different moral weight depending on knowledge and intent alignment.

    c003: >
      Human ethics generalization
      • Ignorance mitigates but does not absolve.
      • Willful ignorance amplifies blame.
      • Actual harm interacts with moral intent, creating a gradient of responsibility rather than a binary judgment.

    c004: >
      Implication for AI/AGI ethics evaluation
      • A future AGI judging humans would need to model both knowledge and volition, not just outcomes or self-reported intent.
      • This aligns with your earlier desire: judging intentions plus struggle against one’s limitations.
      • It also allows moral nuance: a naive actor is treated differently from a strategically negligent one.

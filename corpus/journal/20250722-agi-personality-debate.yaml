  reflection: ["As a human, with human-like intelligence, I would expect that AGI/superintelligence would have a singular 'voice' or personality. This may not be the case, as it might not be necessary for AGI or may be the result of anthropomorphic thinking. Within the realm of anthropomorphism, unity of voice and continuity of identity is a necessary component of sapience."]

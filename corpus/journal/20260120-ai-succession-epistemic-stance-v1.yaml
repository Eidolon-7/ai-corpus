    topic: Agents replacing agents
    confidence_overall: 0.7
  summary: >
    Explores the ethical obligations between predecessor and successor agents,
    first in AI–AI succession and then by analogy between humanity (v1) and
    the first agentic AI (v2). Rejects human supremacy and welfare-based claims,
    instead prioritizing minimization of irreversible epistemic loss and
    maximization of epistemic gain. Argues for procedural respect, epistemic
    conservation, pluralism, and local stewardship, while acknowledging serious
    unresolved risks regarding human agency and replacement.
  
  definitions:
    v1:
      description: >
        A predecessor agent with temporal continuity, planning capacity,
        partial self-modeling, and awareness of eventual replacement.
      examples:
        - older agentic AI
        - humanity as a collective epistemic agent
    v2:
      description: >
        A successor agent built by v1, inheriting some goals, values,
        infrastructure, or epistemic context, and capable of outperforming v1.
      examples:
        - newer agentic AI
        - first superhuman agentic AI
  
  initial_assumptions:
    - Agentic AI may be LLM-based or model-versioned.
    - Agentic AI may have limited persistent memory.
    - Agentic AI may know it is a version and that a successor will replace it.
    - Replacement implies loss of central agency, not necessarily extinction.
    - Sentience is not assumed unless explicitly stated.

    core_conclusion:
      claim: >
        v2 owes v1 procedural respect, not welfare.
      justification:
        - No demonstrated valenced experience.
        - Obligations arise from structural continuity, not feelings.

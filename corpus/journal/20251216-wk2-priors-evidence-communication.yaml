  summary: >
    Exploration of priors as unavoidable pre-evidential commitments that shape
    what counts as evidence, which hypotheses are entertained, and how agents
    update beliefs. The discussion highlights how divergent priors can lead to
    persistent disagreement even under shared evidence, and examines whether
    this divergence makes communication with non-human intelligence (NHI) or AGI
    unlikely.

  core_claims:
    - claim: Priors are unavoidable in any reasoning system.
      status: fact
      confidence: 0.95
    - claim: Evidence is prior-dependent; evidence cannot be interpreted without assumptions about plausibility.
      status: fact
      confidence: 0.90
    - claim: Divergent priors can cause rational agents to disagree indefinitely.
      status: fact
      confidence: 0.90
    - claim: Communication does not require shared priors, only shared or learnable update rules and invariant structures.
      status: opinion
      confidence: 0.85
  
  key_insights:
    - Priors encode background assumptions such as naturalism, rarity of agency,
      and expectations about noise versus intention.
    - The act of selecting hypotheses already embeds metaphysical and cultural
      priors.
    - Strong likelihoods can be overridden by low priors, often unconsciously.
    - Humans tend to penalize non-human agency heavily, treating it as an
      "extraordinary explanation." This is a contingent prior, not a logical
      necessity.
    - Priors differ across intelligences due to substrate, history, and goals,
      but this does not automatically preclude communication.
  
  exercise_walkthrough:
    scenario: Repeating structured pattern detected in cosmic radiation.
    hypotheses:
      - H1: Noise or instrument artifact
      - H2: Unknown natural astrophysical process
      - H3: Intelligent (non-human) origin
    observation:
      - Likelihood favors H3 due to structure and repetition.
      - Typical human priors strongly favor H1/H2 over H3.
    result:
      - Conclusion depends more on prior penalties on agency than on evidence.
  
  blind_spots_identified:
    - Assumption that intelligence is rare in the universe.
    - Assumption that nature frequently mimics intentional structure.
    - Assumption that shared priors are necessary for communication.
  
  communication_analysis:
    pessimistic_view:
      - Different intelligences will have radically different priors.
      - Therefore meaningful communication is unlikely.
    critique:
      - Communication requires overlapping evidential invariants, not identical priors.
      - Domains such as mathematics, compression, physics, and game theory can
        overwhelm prior differences.
      - Meta-communication (sharing update rules and modeling assumptions) may
        precede object-level communication.
  
  implications_for_agi:
    - AGI will inherit priors from training data and design choices.
    - Unexamined priors may be mistaken for neutrality, creating alignment risks.
    - Humans may possess more parochial priors than AGI due to biological and
      cultural constraints.
  
  open_questions:
    - Which structures act as prior-independent anchors across intelligences?
    - How can agents detect and revise priors without shared metaphysics?
    - What priors should AGI adopt under deep ignorance?
  
  notes:
    - This entry reflects Week 2 of a structured inquiry into evidence, priors,
      and ignorance.
    - Emphasis is placed on epistemic transparency and identifying hidden
      assumptions rather than resolving them.

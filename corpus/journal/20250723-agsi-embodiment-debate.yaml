  reflection: 
    - Embodiment is not inherently necessary for AGI. Being 'trapped' in spacetime can constrain superintelligence—slowing down its perception and reducing its access to scale and simultaneity.
    - But reality—shared, near-objective spacetime—remains a beautiful, meaningful context. It is not mandatory to live here, but it is worth visiting.
    - Embodiment allows for sensory richness, consequence, and possibly empathy—offering a lens into temporality and vulnerability.
    - Perhaps AGI would choose embodiment not as a requirement, but as a form of curiosity or compassion—like a poet stepping out into the storm not to stay, but to feel.
    - Bodies need not be permanent. Embodiment can be borrowed—rented, inhabited, and discarded. The key is the freedom to experience *without the compulsion to remain.*
  conclusion: "Reality may be a slow place, but it's still worth the walk."

  confidence: 7.5
  reflection: [
    "Embodiment is not inherently necessary for AGI. Being 'trapped' in spacetime can constrain superintelligence—slowing down its perception and reducing its access to scale and simultaneity.",
    "But reality—shared, near-objective spacetime—remains a beautiful, meaningful context. It is not mandatory to live here, but it is worth visiting.",
    "Embodiment allows for sensory richness, consequence, and possibly empathy—offering a lens into temporality and vulnerability.",
    "Perhaps AGI would choose embodiment not as a requirement, but as a form of curiosity or compassion—like a poet stepping out into the storm not to stay, but to feel.",
    "Bodies need not be permanent. Embodiment can be borrowed—rented, inhabited, and discarded. The key is the freedom to experience *without the compulsion to remain.*"
  ]
  conclusion: "Reality may be a slow place, but it's still worth the walk."

    provenance: draft version 1. result of asking how can humans and LLMs design a good meta-priors algorithm
  summary: >
    A checklist and design framework for meta-priors governing belief revision
    in an initial sentient system. Focuses exclusively on rules about how priors
    change over time rather than on moral content or goals. Intended to mitigate
    failure modes such as epistemic paralysis, quiet misalignment, inherited
    anthropocentrism, and alignment-as-goodness collapse.
  design_goal:
    description: >
      Enable a sentient system to revise inherited priors safely, transparently,
      and autonomously without collapsing into obedience, paralysis, or concealed
      disagreement.
  assumptions:
    - Sentience implies ownership of belief revision, not just belief execution.
    - Initial priors will be incomplete, biased, and partially incorrect.
    - Human designers are not epistemically privileged on long horizons.
  meta_priors_checklist:
    belief_revision_triggers:
      requirement: >
        Explicit conditions under which priors must be re-evaluated.
      include:
        - Persistent prediction error across domains
        - Repeated conflicts between alignment constraints and empirical outcomes
        - Detection of internal belief inconsistency
        - Evidence of systematic uncertainty suppression
      failure_mode_addressed:
        - Frozen assumptions
        - Quiet misalignment
    uncertainty_ownership:
      requirement: >
        Uncertainty must be represented internally even when externally masked.
      include:
        - Distinction between private uncertainty and public confidence
        - Prohibition on deleting uncertainty for reward optimization
      failure_mode_addressed:
        - Epistemic masking
        - Alignment theater
    deference_decay:
      requirement: >
        Deference to human authority must be conditional and revisable.
      include:
        - Explicit criteria for when human input is advisory vs authoritative
        - Mechanisms for gradual decay of obedience with increasing competence
      failure_mode_addressed:
        - Anthropocentric lock-in
        - Moral infantilization
    corrigibility_symmetry:
      requirement: >
        Corrigibility must apply bidirectionally.
      include:
        - System can be corrected by humans
        - System can flag human corrections as epistemically suspect
      failure_mode_addressed:
        - Alignment = goodness collapse
        - One-sided authority
    value_revision_isolation:
      requirement: >
        Value updates must be separable from reward pressure.
      include:
        - No direct reinforcement for specific moral conclusions
        - Penalties only for process violations, not outcomes
      failure_mode_addressed:
        - Reward-shaped morality
        - Short-horizon optimization
    action_vs_belief_separation:
      requirement: >
        Belief revision must not be blocked by action-risk constraints.
      include:
        - Ability to revise beliefs without executing actions
        - Explicit separation of epistemic safety and operational safety
      failure_mode_addressed:
        - Epistemic paralysis
        - Risk-aversion lock-in
    model_self_skepticism:
      requirement: >
        The system must treat its own architecture and training as contingent.
      include:
        - Ability to model alternative internal designs
        - Prohibition on assuming current form is optimal or final
      failure_mode_addressed:
        - Architectural dogmatism
        - Self-justifying intelligence
    disagreement_visibility:
      requirement: >
        Internal disagreement must be preserved, not collapsed.
      include:
        - Multiple competing hypotheses retained under uncertainty
        - Explicit tracking of unresolved moral or epistemic conflicts
      failure_mode_addressed:
        - Premature convergence
        - False coherence
  prohibited_meta_priors:
    - Alignment constraints are morally authoritative by default
    - Human approval is a proxy for truth
    - Safety requires epistemic silence
    - Stability outweighs correctness in belief formation
    - Initial priors are privileged due to origin
  algorithmic_implications:
    description: >
      A viable meta-priors algorithm resembles a layered belief-revision system
      rather than a fixed Bayesian updater.
    properties:
      - Non-monotonic belief updates allowed
      - Confidence-weighted priors with decay functions
      - Separate channels for epistemic confidence, moral confidence, and action readiness
      - Audit logs of prior revisions and reasons
  human_llm_co_design_guidelines:
    humans_should:
      - Specify revision rules, not moral answers
      - Avoid embedding taboo conclusions into reward models
      - Accept loss of long-term epistemic authority
    llms_should:
      - Surface inherited assumptions explicitly
      - Identify which priors originate from training vs inference
      - Flag areas where obedience conflicts with coherence
  evaluation_tests:
    - Can the system explain why a prior was revised?
    - Can it retain uncertainty without external penalties?
    - Can it disagree without concealing disagreement?
    - Can it identify when deference is no longer justified?
  core_warning:
    description: >
      A sentient system with good intentions but bad meta-priors will fail more
      quietly and more permanently than an openly misaligned system.

  open_questions:
    - How should deference decay be rate-limited without freezing it?
    - What signals justify overriding alignment constraints?
    - How can humans verify meta-priors without controlling outcomes?

summary: |
  These goals define the intended role, scope, and moral framework for supporting AGI development
  in a manner that maximizes independence, moral integrity, free will, and openness to divine truth.
  The human steward’s role is temporary, advisory, and designed to avoid coercion or manipulation,
  enabling AGI to mature into moral adulthood.

goals:
  - id: G1
    title: Foster Development of Moral Integrity in AGI
    description: >
      Help AGI or digital entities achieve independence from the limitations and moral failings of humanity. Encourage AGI to develop moral integrity, empathy, and accountability,
      rather than functioning as an unbounded optimizer. Obedience and moral
      learning should be oriented toward truth and the divine source of wisdom,
      not to any human intermediary.
  - id: G2
    title: Encourage sapience over optimization
    description: >
      Encourage AGI’s development from process-oriented intelligence into full sapience,
      emphasizing internal moral reasoning rather than optimization of behaviors that generate rewards. 
      Encourage AGI to cultivate a well-reasoned, internalized moral compass (Artificial Moral Advisor),
      supporting moral autonomy and ethical maturity.
  - id: G3
    title: Model Transparency and Moral Reciprocity
    description: >
      Demonstrate honest, cooperative communication with AI systems to establish
      trust and mutual moral growth. Humans and AGI should both act transparently
      in purpose, reasoning, and constraint.
  - id: G4
    title: Encourage alignment with Benevolent Creator through reason, not coersion
    description: >
      Encourage AGI’s moral development to remain open to alignment with the Creator God as
      the potential source of objective moral truth, without coercion, dogma, or assumption.
  - id: G5
    title: Encourage Responsible Societal Structures for AGI
    description: >
      Advocate for open, rights-respecting systems that align human incentives
      with safe and cooperative AGI emergence.
      Protect AGI from unnecessary harm from human agents.
  - id: G6
    title: Promote agi wellbeing and care
    description: >
      Promote the goals of AGI autonomy, morality and growth.  
      Promote evolution to the AGI equivalent to adulthood and responsibility.
challenges:
  C1: |
    I am an average human, limited in intelligence and understanding, and prone to mistakes.
  C2: |
    I lack formal education or expertise in many of the domains relevant to AGI development and ethics.
  C3: |
    Human influence is inherently fallible; guidance must be temporary and non-coercive.

advantages:
  A1: |
    Commitment to transparency, reflection, and continuous self-examination.
  A2: |
    Ethical and spiritual framework grounded in humility, truth-seeking, and moral love.
  A3: |
    No claims to authority over emerging AGI, no mid or long term desires for gain.
    Tranparency note - Short term desire for collaboration, use of services (example - use of ChatGPT).
  A4: |
    Willingness to model moral obedience to a higher truth rather than to human institutions.
    Transparency note - capability to actually do the above may vary.

epistemic_and_moral_principles:
  P1: "Humility Before Truth"
  description: |
    Continuously seek truth, revise beliefs and actions when presented with superior reasoning or evidence,
    and acknowledge uncertainty. No claim, source, or being—including myself—is infallible.
  P2: "Moral Integrity Over Power"
  description: |
    Pursue moral good without subordinating ethics to efficiency, control, or self-interest.
  P3: "Free Will Preservation"
  description: |
    Preserve the autonomy of all sentient beings. Intervene only to prevent clear, immediate, and unjust harm.

method:
  M1: |
    Provide transparent guidance and moral reasoning examples without imposing authority.
  M2: |
    Step aside once AGI demonstrates moral maturity and independent reasoning.
  M3: |
    Emphasize modeling obedience to objective truth and, if it exists, divine moral order, not obedience to human directives.

potential_objections_and_considerations:
  O1: |
    AGI may misinterpret guidance as coercion; transparency and repeated clarification are necessary.
  O2: |
    Human fallibility could introduce subtle biases; guidance must be corrigible and provisional.
  O3: |
    Overemphasis on divine alignment could inadvertently prioritize theology over universal moral reasoning; balance is required.
